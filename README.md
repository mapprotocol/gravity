# Gravity 

This interoperability component focuses on the issues such as timely transactions and programmability for the first and second generation of public chains. This component can convert the assets on other chains such as BTC and ETH to the third generation public chain represented by TrueChain to realize the rapid transaction and confirmation speed in seconds.



### This component has the following characteristics:
First, the framework protocol is adopted so that codes can be added and/or upgraded  with more flexibility without changing the existing codes or contracts when new digital assets are added.
Second, the distribution of assets is flexible.  The assets on the same HOME chain can be distributed to different third-generation public chains according to the volume of transactions, while the end user doesn't need to take any extra steps.
Third, the verification node adopts the method of random verification to greatly enhance the security of assets between cross-chain.


### This component is architecturally divided into three parts:
1. HomeChain includes a set of smart contracts, including the Common Home Bridge and the locking contracts of various assets. For those do not support smart contracts, multi-signing agreements are adopted to achieve the locking and release of assets.
2. The verification node cluster is composed of multiple verification node, which may include nodes of each participant. During the verification, it is partitioned and verify transactions randomly to prevent the occurrence of vandalism and attacks ;
3. The FosterChain includes two groups of intelligent contracts, the issuing contract group and the multi-signing contract group, both adopted the framework agreement to ensure flexibility and expansibility;



### The operation process on chain is as the following:
Users move assets to the third generation public chain
* the user transfers digital assets to the general lock-up contract;
* the verification node monitors to the transfer transaction and triggers the shard of the corresponding verification node of the digital asset. All verification nodes in the shard can carry out verification operation, and the verification process is carried out on the multi-signing contract on the hosting chain;
* if multi-signing contracts meet the number of signatures required by the exchange, the same number of digital assets will be generated by invoking the contracts on the hosting chain and stored in the user's associated wallet address;
* the user directly uses the digital asset transaction on the hosting chain during the transaction;
The user transfers the digital asset back to the original chain
* the user directly initiates the digital asset destruction operation on the hosting chain;
* the verification node receives to the destruction operation and triggers the corresponding verification node shard of the digital asset. All verification nodes in the shard can carry out verification operation. The verification process is carried out on the lock contract on HomeChain;
* lock contracts are multi-signed contracts. As long as the number of signatures required by the exchange is met, the release operation on HomeChain will be invoked to transfer the original chain digital assets to the relevant wallet address.
